                <ul>1.What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible?<ul>

                <p>One thing that I think I would change is I added some video to my app this week and after seeing the slide in the resources I have come to see how closed minded my app was and how it is really not that accessible to a lot of people. For one I did not add multiple tracks to my video incase the person wanted to hear it in a different language I am assuming the person speaks English. I would like to make a Spanish track since I can do that my self-being Spanish speaking. I also know sign language so maybe I would add a lil man on the side signing what I am saying too.</p>

                <ul>2.Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" - what are some of the common frustrations that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them?</ul>

                <p> Well some examples show that some screen readers read all the content even stuff that is not important like item the code of word tabs that go into the millions. Or if the web inspector was open it could go an infinitely read some code that is prewritten. Also if not coded properly it will go into reading tags and takes the user a few attempts to find search results. I think I would fix this by  ….. I really don’t know how to fix this but I would try and make categories for easier audio navigating. Like 4 per page and only have 4 actions on per page. Or even install a voice command of what u would like to do..</p>

                 <ul>3.	Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</ul>

                  <p> I think one device would be the old school TTY device that were made for deaf people to use the phone. Also mac has added Voice Over to every Mac with lion “to make it easier for the blind” it’s a brail system</p>

                 <ul>4.Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility. .</ul>
                  <p>Voice command, Talk’N Text
